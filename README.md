My name is James Davidson and I an alumni of University of Houston with a backgroud in Finance. I started out in the banking industry doing commercial lending before moving to the mortgage and real estate industry before the market downturn in Fall 2022. After getting laid off, when our start-up compnay went under, I transitioned into the energy industry working for a company that does 3rd party servicing and purchacsing for solar panels. My career goals are currently up in the air as my previous career goals and path was upended with the downtrun of the mortgage and consumer real estate industry. I am at a point of transition in my life and decided I needed to try something new to make myself more valuable in the market. Technology is the way of the new world and isn't going anywhere so instead of getting left behind I figured I would compound my education and expierence with finance and merge it into the new world of FinTech.
